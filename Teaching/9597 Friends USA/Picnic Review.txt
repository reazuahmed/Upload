2. Amirul (Accountant)
3. Afzal
4. Mahbub
6. Khokon
5. Tuhin

Till now our gaining:
	1) The best picnic committee
	2) The best admins and admin panel where we can see the light of creativity with positivity only.
	
	I strongly hope and believe that we will be able to keep it up.
	
	New friends will be added to us for different responsibilities. But, the process and policies we already have established will be better - not worse.
